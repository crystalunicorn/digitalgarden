##### Description
- silver masked face
- appears through a mirror during prayer
- a prophet for [[4. World/Historical Figures/Jalanvaloss\|Jalanvaloss]], a Silver Dragon.

##### Notes
- first seen when arriving in Riverbed, in a mirror inside a dwarf home - [[Inbox - Session Notes/2022-09-25\|2022-09-25]]
- convinced town Jalanvaloss is a *diety* to be worshiped over [[4. World/Dieties/Ilmater\|Ilmater]]
	- conveniently appeared during [[4. World/Lore/The Fall of Ilmater\|The Fall of Ilmater]] to convert the townsfolk
- prayer must be done inside, appears compulsory
- colloquially known as Papa John
	- offensive to the 'older' worshipers


##### Mirrors
- when appearing in a mirror, appears to be a person and not a statue
	- movements very slight
	- beneath is the slow rising of a breath
	- appears to be holding their breath for short periods to stay as still as possible
- one-way mirrors of scrying
	- the figure can see us in real time
	- we see a projection of the figure
- used for surveillance
- mostly appear indoors, none seen outside (so far)
