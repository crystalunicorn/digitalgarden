# The Dragons Stir...

*The [[Chromatic Dragons\|Chromatic]] and [[1. Characters/Factions/Metallic Dragons\|Metallic]] Dragons are waking and we don't know how or why.*

[[1. Characters/Factions/The Gemstone Dragons\|The Gemstone Dragons]] have tasked us with preventing another [[Metallic & Chromatic Dragon Wars\|Dragon War]] in whatever way we can.

So far, we know very little about the situation. It's likely each faction of dragon have also called upon Champions like us to further their own goals. *It's safe to assume we have enemies at every turn.* It may be in our best interest to keep our ties with The Gemstone Dragons under wraps.

**We've been given these suggestions by The Gemstone Dragons:**
- Fight the dragons.
- Prevent the dragons from waking.
- Find [[Sardior\|Sardior]].
    - a dragon more powerful than any other
    - there are only rumors of it's existence
- Break out [[1. Characters/Factions/The Gemstone Dragons\|The Gemstone Dragons]] from the [[Astral Plane\|Astral Plane]].
- Find the dragon-made fabled longsword, [[2. Mysteries/Cyzste Zimno\|Cyzste Zimno]].
- _We can, of course, think of alternatives. These are just suggestions._
