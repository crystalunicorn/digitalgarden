*Colosseum-like amphitheater of white marble.*

## Notes
- small fish swim through the stonework and walkways
- some sort of brass ball is the source of the projections #unsure 
- large slab above the center of the court, seems sports-like
- people seem to be chilling in the stands, appears to be a place to mill around
- building gifted by [[2. Mysteries/Father Jonathan\|Father Jonathan]]
- once in a while people partake in a game of **'Basket Ball'**

### Basket Ball
- 2 teams of 5 deliver ball into hoops for points
- bloody sport, ==blood comes from enchantments on the ball== and what happens over the course of the game #blood
	- contact seems permitted
- winning team is the "Riverbed Rogues" lmao
