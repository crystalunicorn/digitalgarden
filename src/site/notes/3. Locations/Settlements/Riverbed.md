*Riverside settlement and home of what looks to be a cult?*

## Description
- A large riverside settlement north of Honeymoon Island, in The Smaragd Mer
- West of The Devoted Rivers
- Split into West and East sides
- A crumbling [[3. Locations/Buildings & Landmarks/Giant Mouse Statue of Ilmater|Giant Mouse Statue of Ilmater]] is at the North point of town in the middle of the river

## Notes
- Suspected hideout of the [[2. Mysteries/'Ghostly' Figure|'Ghostly' Figure]].
- 'astral' fish swim overhead, which give off light rather than torchlight
- residents of Riverbed don't look *happy*, but appear grateful for what they have
- **hours of worship:** as soon as the sun touches the hills (dawn and dusk)
- 'Morality Police' wearing black robes and differently colored stripes under their armpits roam the city
- townsfolk don't take kindly to any criticism of accommodations, *"Are Father's tidings not suitable for you?"*
- ==[[4. World/Creatures/Lizardfolk|Lizardfolk]] spotted in the [[3. Locations/Buildings & Landmarks/Giant Mouse Statue of Ilmater|Giant Mouse Statue of Ilmater]]==

### Overheard
*"Better government, better people."*
*"A good person always does the work, no matter how efficient."*
