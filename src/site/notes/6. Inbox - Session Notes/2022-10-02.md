# All Work and D'oh Play
## summary:
Our first day in Riverbed, an *interesting* village. Most storefronts seem a mess, the denizens don't appear happy but still grateful for what they have. There's a... cultish admiration of Father Jonathan, his influence is seen everywhere. Guards in black robes or black armor prowl the streets, akin to morality police no doubt. Mirrors hang all around the interiors, the eyes of Father Jonathan are everywhere.
The group procures residence in an Inn, then split up to do this or that in town.
Bast tours the town, managing to piss off everyone she comes across but learns quite a lot at the Church of the Father.
Orpheus and Emile visit an alchemist to drop off the Black Sludge to be examined. Hopefully that old halfling stays safe...
Julierose and Syn head out to survey the tunnel, discovering something--likely a bear--has taken residence inside. While out, Julierose spots a tailed creature scurrying into the giant mouse statue North of town.
The party reconvenes and (most) knowledge is exchanged. Salem is sent to confirm the presence of lizardfolk and any survivors. Salem spots the lizards, but is shot down by two armored guards from afar, which tells us access to the statue is forbidden.
While Orpheus casts his bones, Bast and Syn have a big argument over Bast supposedly signing us up for the 'basket ball' game as "The Chosen Ones" which would not be great for keeping our cover. Orpheus lets us know that "whoever's waiting for help in the statue won't be at risk if they stay there another day." Bast is then dragged away to take our names off the sign-up sheet, where hilarity and hijinks ensues.
Meanwhile, Orpheus takes Julierose upstairs in the inn, having a heart-to-heart. He then makes a decision.
***Orpheus reveals to the mirror that we have gemstone scales.*** ^summary

# Leaf, Moss, and Fur
## summary:
Before our adventure, we have a slight rewind and chat with Ambesh the Crystal. We learn an incredible amount about Cyzste Zimno and tangentially about The Holy Light, Ymearlis, and Ashardalon. It's an incredibly productive conversation that leaves us with many more questions.
On our way to Riverbed, we stop by Pappy Hollow, restock, deck out our cart, and continue onwards.
On the road, we have a strange encounter with a Stone Golem, Gargamel, keeping some travelers captive. Julierose manages to placate the creature while Syn ferries the captives away.
Later, we have yet another odd encounter that traps us in a loop, replaying again and again while a Madman innoculated with Black Sludge hunts us down. Thanks to some quick thinking by Bast, we're freed from the loop. We discover the Madman is Shia Zenberu, who's connected to the Mono'lak by virtue of an insignia tattooed onto his arm. This has worrying implications.
Finally we arrive in Riverbed. Some sort of curfew is in order, soldiers bark at people to head indoors because "Papa's waiting, get inside for worship."
A kindly dwarf allows us into his home and prays in front of a mirror. A fog rolls over his reflection and a silver face appears. We hear the dwarf mutter:
*"Praise be to him, all hail Papa John."* ^summary

# Qlhrzs Mlin

## summary:
The session focuses on our long rest while in Azmarin Village.
We learn a bit about Marigold Moon, namely that she is of the Court of Aspirant, is searching for Cyzste Zimno, and is aware of the Gemstone Dragon's existence. We pour over her research regarding Zimno and The Holy Light.
Over the days we're showered by praise from the villagers. We're given a cart and a horse--named Meadow--by the leader of the village. The children give us all little makeshift toys, it's incredibly touching--especially to Syn.
Because of this, Syn makes a last-minute decision to steer the party towards Riverbed, in hopes of finding the villagers she failed to recover before.
*We jump in our cart and head for Poppy Hollow...* ^summary

# The Way Forward

## summary:
We speak with Saur'barag at length. It's quickly discovered that Orpheus is not a Chosen One, a man named Sedrick is. Orpheus took the dragon stone after a vision told him this Sedrick's journey would end in tragedy.
A scuffle happens while we subdue Orpheus, with Bast attempting to do serious harm to him. Julierose steps up and agrees to be Orpheus' keeper in order to keep him with us.
Once things calm down, Saur'barag fills us in on many things, namely the Dragon Wars over 1000 years ago.
*Saur'barag tells us that the dragons are waking up.* The Gemstone Dragons have chosen us as their champions to save the world, essentially. He gives us a few choices on how we can do that, but ultimately it's up to us.
As the vision fades, we're given a choice. Go to Riverbed, or return to Azmarin Village. Syn strongly suspects the sacrifices have been ferried off somewhere between Riverbed and the Northern cave opening, but we don't want to miss meeting with Marigold Moon again.
In the end, we choose Azmarin Village, using the power of Emile's gemstone. We blink across space and, as soon as we land, *Emile goes into cardiac arrest.* ^summary

# Beneath the Hill

## summary:
We head into the cave, sneaking in thanks to the Kingsmen's help.
Carefully scouting through, thanks to Bast's familiar, we discover a few things:
• A 'Ghostly' Figure and a King Lizardfolk appear to be arguing in Draconic.
• The holding cages for sacrifices is empty.
• There is a Giant Lizard sleeping in an offshoot den.
We confront the king, attracting the attention of the 'Ghostly' Figure who decries us for "poking our head in" and condemns us to death. Very dramatic.
It's another hard fought battle but we just manage to win *mostly* unscathed. We're unable to prevent the Giant Lizard from causing a cave in, cutting us off from the exit...
While looking for an escape, we discover a few curious things in the cave:
• The circle the 'Ghostly' Figure appeared within seem to be a variation of a teleportation circle. It transports a persons *image* rather than their form. **The other sigil is in Riverbed.**
• Orpheus finds burnt and tattered books about Honeymoon Island, specifically *the seasons & changes in temps*. They are all from the Mono'lak Observatory.
• He also finds one children's book about a knight that fought the dragons thousands of years ago. Hindsight makes us suspect it's Cyzste Zimno.
• Julierose finds a map that seems to describe an attempt to connect the cave to another one across the river, near Riverbed.
We find an exit by way of a narrow tunnel heading north. It takes an hour to travel through and spits us out towards Riverbed. At this point, Orpheus confronts the party on what brought them all together...
We all reveal our gemstones. They begin to glow and float under the full moon... *Saur'barag the Obsidian makes contact.* ^summary

	- **physical (?) form:** *"What form does Cyzste Zimno take?"*
		- Myrthe the Emerald has seen it

	- Bast casts dispell on the figure and breaks the loop
	- the 'inky black substance' dissipates into the ground once 'defeated'
- 'inky black substance' gives off the magical aura of:

	- enchantment
- Orpheus freezes a small marble-sized bit of 'the substance'
- investigate the body and a cabin nearby
- Shia Zenberu is 'the figure'

</div></div>

## log:
Orpheus and Julierose pray along with the dwarf before the mirror

- Prayer in the western side of Riverbed is a *forced thing*, not doing so gets you questioned

*"Better government better people."* is a mantra said by the... Papa John worshipers...

- Silver-masked visage looks like a statue.
	- Looks like a person, movements very slight, shimmering over mirror
	- Beneath is the slow rising of a breath, appears to be holding their breath for short periods
	- One-way mirror of scrying, the figure can see us in real time, we see a projection of the figure

'Astral' fish swim overhead which give off light rather than torchlight 

- **The [[3. Locations/Buildings & Landmarks/Running Halfling and the Belt|Running Halfling and the Belt]]:** a 'dirty' inn, beautiful view of the rivers
	- clear view of the Eastern side of the river, where people dance on balconies
	- floor creaks under every step
	- cobwebs everywhere and vomit stains the wood

- **The [[3. Locations/Buildings & Landmarks/Father's Court|Father's Court]]:** Amphitheatre of white marble, appears colosseum-like
	- small fish swim through the stonework and walkways
	- some sort of brass ball is the source of the projections #unsure 
	- large slab above the center of the court, seems sports-like
	- people seem to be chilling in the stands, appears to be a place to mill around
	- building gifted by Father Jonathan
	- once in a while people partake in a game of 'basket ball'

- **The Excellent Dungeon:** general store, only shop that seems open late

Dark shadowy *thing* disappears down an alley near The Brick

- Residents of Riverbed don't look *happy* but appear grateful for what they have

Rent 2 rooms in the Running Halfling - 11cp

Feed Bast (not staying in the inn) - 1cp

- **Hours of worship in Riverbed:** as soon as the sun touches the hills (dawn and dusk)

- 'Morality Police' wear black robes with red and green stripe under their armpit

- **[[1. Characters/NPCs/Aelyn the Innskeeper|Aelyn the Innskeeper]]:** appears to truly believe in Father Jonathan

Bast wanders away to get in trouble investigate the town

- **[[3. Locations/Buildings & Landmarks/The Brick|The Brick]]:** a square brick building apparently guarded by black armor-clad knights
	- they do not allow people close by

*"Father Jonathan the savior the destroyer of ... (???)"* #unsure 

*"Only text is in the Church of the Father"*

- **[[3. Locations/Buildings & Landmarks/Church of the Father|Church of the Father]]:** large cathedral-like building in the center of town #lore 
	- bell that signifies worship hanging here
	- statue in front of the doorway of the visage of Father Jonathan
	- lining the church are scrolls
	- black robed figures with green and white stripes chat among themselves and read scrolls
	- lectern with a person in fancy black robes reading something off it
	- 3 stained glass windows
		- depicting statue of a large mouse surrounded by a church, standing tall among Riverbed, way over 50 ft tall standing in riverbed
		- same image, roaring white waves, cracked statue
		- Father Johnathan with crowd of people kneeling before them, stopping a wave with his hands and protecting the crowd
	- **The Fall of Ilmater**
		- Luren Ray (a beast) showed up in the town, a bad omen
		- flooding of the devoted rivers
		- crumbling of dutiful structure
		- Father Jonathan says there is another: Jalon Valas
			- a sort of prophet
			- possibly a chosen one of a metallic dragon
		- **Ilmater:** "the broken god" worshiped by people outside of ruler's reach, said to promise good tidings in the face of suffering, acts as a shield against horrible fates that befall their worshipers, one of the first to experience the Schism/great betrayal
	- Courtrooms and where FJ speak to Jalon Valas is above the cathedral
	- **[[4. World/Historical Figures/Jalon Valas|Jalon Valas]]:**
		- prime arc silver dragon
			- one of the first to make the metallic dragons born
		- NOT a god, very odd the people are calling it a god

Townsfolk seem suspicious of Bast's disproval of the inn, "Are Father's tidings not suitable for you?"

Two mirrors are facing each bed in the room in the inn

Syn tries and fails to knock the mirrors over (with Julierose following her lead...)

- Winners of "Basket Ball" may join a feast with Father Jonathan
	- 2 teams of 5 deliver ball into hoops for points
	- blood comes from enchantments on the ball and what happens over the course of the game
	- "Riverbed Rogues" lmao

Bast manages to offend a holy man lol...

- **The [[3. Locations/Buildings & Landmarks/Glass Alchemist|Glass Alchemist]]:** cluttered and dangerous, lots of spills, etc
	- run by an old halfling (probably the mentioned "hag" lmao)

Orpheus and Emile go to the apothecary or w/e
	- Orpheus wants to get Black Sludge inspected (still frozen)
	- suspects it's an inorganic organism, parasitic in nature
	- sample is left with the halfling to be picked up mid morn

Some abandoned houses, a dark fish hanging in the air above one of the houses
	- flies off when Orpheus notices it
	- looks dark, possible a rag, seemed odd

Syn and Julierose head out to look for the tunnel, and any signs of Lizardfolk/etc.

Julierose notices movement on the [[3. Locations/Buildings & Landmarks/Giant Mouse Statue of Ilmater|Giant Mouse Statue of Ilmater]]
	- something with a tail scurries into the mouth

Julierose and Syn reach the tunnel, reconsider collapsing it just yet
	- smells like something has been living in it
	- small bear-like tracks (likely a cub, which means a momma bear will prob be around)
	- ==lizard-like tracks approached the tunnel from Riverbed, stayed 30ft away==

*"A good person always does the work no matter how efficient."* - Aelyn reciting some sort of psalm

Orpheus telepathically asks if Aelyn has seen any lizardfolk in town
	- shakes her head, looks in disgust that someone would do this in their mind

Bast (retroactively) signs us up for basket ball as "The Chosen Ones"

Orpheus sends Salem off to scout the giant mouse statue
	- goals:
		- verify lizardfolk
		- verify survivors
		- verify silver-masked figure operating there
	- spotted by two armored guards, one with green and red stripe, one orange stripe (destroyed Salem)
	- ==saw the same markings of lizardfolk as in azmarin village==

Bast & Syn have a long argument lmao

Orpheus says that someone who's waiting on our help in the statue will be fine if we don't go right now, or some shit

Bast, Syn, Emile go to take their team name off the sign-up sheet
	- Bast reveals their real names aren't on the sheet, so they... just don't have to show up...
	- Bast asks Emile why he didn't say so earlier (lol)

**Orpheus reveals to the mirror that we have gemstone scales**
