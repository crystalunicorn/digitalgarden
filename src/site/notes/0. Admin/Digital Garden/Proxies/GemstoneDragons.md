## **Dragon Wars**
- ended in 482 (current year is 1482)
- incredibly destructive drawn-out world
	- created and destroyed lots of life
- metallic vs chromatic dragons
	- both have very different visions of  how to rule
	- chromatic wish to rule with an iron fist
	- metallic wish to rule with absolute loyalty
	- similar to Chaos vs Order when brought to their extremes

## **[[2. Mysteries/Cyzste Zimno|Cyzste Zimno]]**
- *"What is Cyzste Zimno?"*
- prison for a portion of [[Ymearlis|Ymearlis]] (the Ice Lord/Elemental Titan mentioned in "[[2. Mysteries/Marigold Moon's Research#The Chosen Warden|The Chosen Warden]]")
- **physical (?) form:** *"What form does Cyzste Zimno take?"*
	- [[Myrthe the Emerald|Myrthe the Emerald]] has seen it
	- refers to the *item*, not the *person* holding it
		- although the two are often conflated
	- it is the physical prison forged by The Holy Light, Ashardalon, to beat back Ymearlis
	- ==form: **fabled longsword**==
		- said to hold the cold essence of the titan (Ymearlis) itself

- **The Nature of Ymearlis' Imprisonment**
	- *"What is the nature of Ymearlis' imprisonment?"*
	- "brutal"
	- eviscerated the right hand
	- [[Ymearlis|Ymearlis]] (what's left of him) is locked in plane of ice, a 'portion' is within Cyzste Zimno
	- Ignacious is locked in plane of fire
	- Malva: "Whoever wields it will never rest, for the wielder of the sword is the Champion of Winter."
		- likely an item that is a curse as much as a boon

## **The Holy Light**
- *"What exactly is the Holy Light?"*
- known as "parent" to dragon kind
- brought the first dragon into existence, forever known as [[Ashardalon|Ashardalon]]
- "almost like answered prayers" to those wishing for salvation from "the blight that the Flame and Ice brought upon the Material"
- it is something above the dragons, unsure exactly what "The [[Holy Light|Holy Light]]" truly is
- stood against the flames, controlling and bending them to it's own will
- became The Betrayer for beating back Ymearlis

### **Ashardalon**
- leader of The Chromatic Dragons
- THE Ancient Red Dragon
- often conflated with "The Holy Light"
