# I Blade You Farewell Pt.2
## summary:
...

---

## log:
Emile, Julierose, and Orpheus head to Western Riverbed through the well. Julierose and Orpheus have trouble scaling the rope, but overcome it.

There's a commotion in the courtyard. Orpheus leaves Salem with the other two and investigates. He spots an odd black cloth--similar to what we've seen before. In the courtyard, an execution is happening. A black-haired dwarf is the subject.

*"... and thus, with the introduction of the heretics from before, we found the culprit!"*

The dwarf is the very same one that gave us shelter during the first prayer.

The GM claims [[2. Mysteries/Father Jonathan\|Father Jonathan]] has given guidance to weed out the heretics.

The dwarf is hanged.

Julierose and Emile have an easy walk to the abandoned hut Idane Rumblegrove is hiding in. She looks very pale and haggard, unrested, but alive. Is informed Lori Nadril has fetched for her. She agrees, isn't confident she can make it. Shaylee and Casper agree to come along.

Emile, Idane, Casper, and Shaylee make it safely down the well. Before descending, Idane gives Julierose an item. Gnarled twisted root, inlaid with a golden script.

Orpheus attempts to steal away the dwarf's body, with the help of Julierose. Orpheus exercises his new warlock powers, which exhilarates and shakes him.

Orpheus and Julierose escape down the well with the dwarf's body.

Bast and Synadriel search for Ennui using Detect Magic. We find him disguised as a big-bosomed lady (lol) selling charcoal sketches at the Feasting Fields. We take our conversation somewhere private.

Bast and Synadriel convince Ennui (using intimidation,) to stand in for Jian'lashen for a few days using his disguise ability--which turns out to be an (uncomfortable) enchanted mask. (Also Ennui isn't really married.)

- Where might someone find strong bodies to use as champions?
	- Rapid Rascal (a cat house) where former champions tend to hang about.
	- Hearts Cell, a place people work.
	- Feasting Field, lots of types hang around there.

- **Bear Shopping:** (Welded Hammer, plus some general stores.)
	- hunting trap, two manacles - 7sp
	- 2 catch poles - 1sp
	- 10 toxin vials - 1sp 60cp
	- sturdy muzzle - 20cp
	- hire unnamed muscle - 1sp per day
	- 2 big fat salmon - 5cp

## log:
Julierose and Orpheus have a brief conversation RE: skeletal hand & Orpheus' emotional state.

Emile and Syn have a discussion RE: possibly restoring his appendages using a grisly sacrifice. Emile agrees to have the transplant.

Emile is sworn into the Hidden Blades, practicing his new movement using Cassidy's help.

Orpheus and Syn have a (terrible) conversation RE: teamwork, agency, etc. The two reach a contentious agreement to try and work as a team. (Wow these two are just total opposites and don't see eye-to-eye whatsoever.) There was a lot of verbal chess going on lol. Orpheus seemed hung up on morality, whereas Syn was more concerned about agency.

Bast relaxes at an inn and flirts with [[Ennui\|Ennui]] the Tiefling! (He drew a portrait of Bast!) (He's asking for a job opportunity, hearing Bast is a noble lmao.) (Wow he's laying it on thick.) (Bast is painted naked!!!!!!) Ennui is quite the talker. He asks about Bast's impressions of Western and Eastern Riverbed. Bast puts the moves on Ennui (who turns out to be married and objects) (but is persuaded to participate anyway) (oh god).

The group has a meeting with [[Lori Nadril\|Lori Nadril]]. Julierose is sworn in. The party agrees to help the [[Hidden Blade\|Hidden Blade]] usurp [[Kaiser\|Kaiser]] and [[2. Mysteries/Father Jonathan\|Father Jonathan]]. ==Kaiser and Jonathan must be dealt with before the next Fryg/next week.==

- [[Xan Jian'lashen\|Xan Jian'lashen]] hails from the [[Kunimi Throne\|Kunimi Throne]], which is known for their assassins and formidable warriors. #unsure 

The four targets--the Senators--==gather every Turin== for a secret game after the Colosseum. This might be the best time to pounce.

### Tentative Plans for Next Session:
##### Western Riverbed
- Orpheus, Emile, and Julierose go to acquire the archmage [[Idane Rumblegrove\|Idane Rumblegrove]]
- Orpheus confers with the alchemist he inquired with previously at the [[3. Locations/Buildings-Landmarks/Glass Alchemist\|Glass Alchemist]]
##### Eastern Riverbed
- Synadriel joins Bast as she searched for the blue tiefling [[Ennui\|Ennui]] via detect magic radar
- Success or not, they meet with Jon Oro; may reconvene with group beforehand
##### Optional
- get bear? üêª
