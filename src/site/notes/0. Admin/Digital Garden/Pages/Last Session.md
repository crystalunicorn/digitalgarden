# Life and Limb
## summary:
... (To be Written)

---
 
## log:
Orpheus heads to the Feasting Field, gathering enough components to resummon Salem. He removes the obsidian gemstone from Salem's circlet and heads deeper into the cavern beneath Riverbed.

Syn & Bast head to Kaiser's Colosseum, through the Feasting Field. Eastern Riverside seems well-maintained on the Feasting Field, compared to Western.
- Almost a long forum, people discuss all sorts of things, including politics.
- 28 total senators, all 4 targets are senators.
	- Senators in a small village seems like overkill, especially *28.* Traditionally, Senators are representatives of the people and *should* be accessible to the people, via meetings etc. Typically contacted through a secretary who knowns their schedule better.

Bast and Syn pretend to be a traveling dignitary and her bodyguard, passing through to pay their respects and ask about the (fascinating) local politics. We gather information...
- **The Targets:**
	- ==All Senators that surround [[Lori Nadril\|Lori Nadril]]'s territory.==
	- Jon Oro: Southern merchant feasting field.
		- family crest: two fish cresting over into each other, singular rod betwixt them
		- description: older gentleman, deep wrinkles, white hair on a balding head, clean-shaven, yellow robes with black fur over shoulders
	- Ferro Clacks: halfling woman (guarded)
	- Adaine Blanche: half-elven woman (guarded)
	- ==Xan Jian'lashen: human man, black hair, *similar build to Emile* (unguarded)==
- Acquire a flyer with the addresses of every Senator.
- The secratary is chained to the desk in Jon Oro's office. Government work--at least for secretaries--appears to be an indentured service.

(Bast's full title is: *Sabast'e Oussand of Megwandiir Clan, Da'nos of the Fourth Eye*)

Emile, with Cassidy's help, manifests a phantom hand for a brief moment.

A luminescent fish swims into Lori's tent, brightens, then the light dissipates.

Julierose and Emile have a conversation RE: Julie's missing hand.

Orpheus heads deeper into the tunnels, at a crossroads, with the obsidian gemstone. [[Saur'barag the Obsidian\|Saur'barag]]'s eye briefly appears.

Orpheus makes contact with *something* and makes a pact. (Woo Warlock!) ==**Orpheus throws away the obsidian gemstone.**== (NOTE: James did an incredible job describing and voicing this whole encounter, holy shit. Truly captivating and terrifying, what a great treat to receive on Halloween.)

Bast asks Syn if it's possible to transplant someone's eyes. (It is, but requires a very dexterous hand to do so.) She then secures a room at the [[Torn Table\|Torn Table]]. A circular inn, circular tables, circular spire, etc. 1SP per day per room. They part ways, Syn heads back down to the [[Hidden Blade\|Hidden Blade]] hideout.

==Orpheus "restores" Julierose's hand. **It's skeletal now**==. He tries to do the same for Emile, but Syn gets in his way. The two have an altercation, Orpheus claiming this action counts as an apology, that he *"Fixed it"*, and Syn, mortified, repeatedly saying *"She didn't want that!"* 

In the end, Orpheus heads away, with Julierose following him. 

==*Orpheus then coughs up black sludge.*==

# Brick by Brick
## summary:
... (To be Written)

---

## log:
Julie & Emile head deeper into [[3. Locations/Buildings-Landmarks/The Brick\|The Brick]]. 
They both fall under some kind of enchantment and succumb to The Brick.

[[2. Mysteries/Father Jonathan\|Father Jonathan]] orders for the capture (or killing) of Bast, Orpheus, and Syn. A fight breaks out with villagers and guards chasing.

Orpheus tells us to help the Red Knights heading to The Brick we saw before--reportedly from Fort Joy (?) *We enter combat.*

##### Combat Cliffnotes
- Orpheus gets the attention of the Red Knights, who seem to be allies.
- Red Knights return Orpheus' satchel (in a sweet toss).
- Orpheus tells us to go South (q_q)
- Bast has people eaten by fucking spiders.

##### The Brick (In Tandem to Combat)
- Julierose feeds a fuzzy rabbit some rations (left hand).
- Emile imagines his paradise is with Cassidy and takes her hand (right hand).
- ==Emile wakes up... without a **right hand** or **both feet**.== (Q_Q)
- ==Julierose is missing a **left hand**.==
- Emile dispatches the butcher and wakes Julierose.
- They recover their things, Julierose carries Emile upstairs (through some kind of freezer with 'meat cuts')

The gang is reunited. Synadriel heals Emile's leg stumps (crying) to prevent major blood loss. Half the party fends off guards while the rest run. Eventually we all jump down a well together, heading South.

The well is dotted with air pockets. Takes 20 minutes to move through.

Cavern is at the end of the tunnel. An encampment is here (several banners, tents, swords,) dark clothes, dark cloaks, no identifying marks. 15-20 people. They relax when they see the two Red Knights breech.

[[Lori Nadril\|Lori Nadril]], 'leader' of the [[Hidden Blade\|Hidden Blade]], greets us. (Description: thick black hair, gold bands, somewhat ornately dressed. Dignified air.) (Formerly a senator. Claims not to lead the Hidden Blade, *"You cannot will steel."*)

Orpheus and Bast join Nadril for a chat. 
- The [[Hidden Blade\|Hidden Blade]] remembers [[4. World/Dieties/Ilmater\|Ilmater]]'s greatness. Nadril wants to kill [[Kaiser\|Kaiser]], the leader of Eastern Riverbed. They seek to remove the false prophets.
- Bast divulges the false prophets worship a [[4. World/Historical Figures/Jalanvaloss\|Silver Dragon]].
	- Nadril does not believe this, but believes the group share a common goal.
- Nadril extends an offer to join the cause.

Bast briefly exits but listens in.
- Orpheus pledges allegance. 
- Asks for things necessary to restore limbs. Is referred to Nadril's daughter [[Nora Nadril\|Nora]].

Emile and Julierose are being tended to, Syn stays with them.
- [[Nora Nadril\|Nora Nadril]] attends to their wounds.
- Options to restore limbs:
- Make a deal (risky)
	- **Otherworldly Patronage:** possibly with a deal, or something else
	- deal with *"whoever answers your call"*
	- needs to be at a crossroads in the black of night
- Get dirty
- Magical restoration (difficult, expensive)
	- about 5 gold
		- need to find someone with the gems on hand, won't be easy
	- Emile has: 999 silver (given to Syn)
- Smithy for prosthetics (need something in return, don't deal with gold)
	- **Automail:** takes time and physical therapy. needs regular upkeep.
- Primal substitute (requires research)
	- **Elemental Substitute:** requires primal magic, very occult and hidden
- Carver for wood prosthetics

Orpheus and Bast rejoin the 3 being tended to, briefly talks with Nora RE: Red Knight's health, options to help Julie and Emile.

- [[Zarrow Swiftsong\|Zarrow Swiftsong]] hands out the cloaks and conducts the admission into the [[Hidden Blade\|Hidden Blade]].
	- being sworn in involves two slices across the forearm and drinking a poison/truth serum to unwittingly divulge a hidden truth.

To help gather appendages for our friends, we are given assassination targets to be eliminated on behalf of the [[Hidden Blade\|Hidden Blade]].
- Targets to be eliminated:
	- Ferro Clacks
	- Adaine Blanche
	- Xan Jian'lashen
	- Jon Oro
- Places to find targets:
	- Feasting Field
	- Hearts Cell
	- Kaiser's Colosseum

Orpheus refuses to help Bast and Syn harvest 'the resources necessary' to restore Emile's appendages, stating he'll help them in his own way. It's also revealed the two parties don't trust each other. (Orpheus also offered his own arm for the job, but was rejected for being 'too scrawny for Emile')

Julierose agrees to help Syn with the process of restoring Emile's appendages, but declines the help herself, stating that she's fine this way. *"You may not understand this, but I feel free now."*
